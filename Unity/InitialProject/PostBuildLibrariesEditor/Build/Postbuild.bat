REM 1. Create a new, empty project which only use is to copy all dlls to Unity.
REM    Make sure it uses .NET 3.5 to be compatible with Unity.
REM
REM 2. Reference all dll projects to this new project.
REM
REM 3. Put a copy of this batch file into the project folder (e.g. into a folder called Build).
REM 
REM 4. Put this line into the post-build event of your project 
REM    (replace PATH_TO_UNITY_PROJECT by the path to the unity project folder):
REM    "$(ProjectDir)Build\Postbuild.bat" PATH_TO_UNITY_PROJECT $(TargetDir)
REM
REM 5. The project will be compiled after all dll projects (as they are referenced by this project)
REM    and the dlls will be copied into the target directory of the project.
REM
REM    Then the post-build event will call this batch file, which will copy all dlls from the
REM    target directory into the plugins folder of your unity project except for unity dlls.
